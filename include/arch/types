int8_t      signed at least 8 bit integer
uint8_t     unsigned at least 8 bit intege
int16_t     signed at least 16 bit integer
uint16_t    unsigned at least 16 bit integer
int32_t     signed at least 32 bit integer
uint32_t    unsigned at least 32 bit integer
int64_t     signed at least 64 bit integer
uint64_t    unsigned at least 64 bit integer
float_t     at least 32 bit floating point
double_t    at least 64 bit floating point
